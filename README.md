# Web Blog

The Web Blog Site is a full-stack web application that was develop as a learning process, to explore the depths of full-stack technologies. Note that it is not intended to be an actual service. The application allows registered users to create, view, and manage blog posts in a user-friendly interface, while unregistered visitors can freely browse all posts. It provides a seamless experience for both readers and registered writers, with features like user authentication, post creation, post categories, and a responsive layout.
